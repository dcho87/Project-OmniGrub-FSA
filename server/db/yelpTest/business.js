Coffee, smoothies, breakfast burritos...all fresh and awesome, and I love the fast, friendly staff. However, due to the impossible parking, I started going to the upper De La Vina location shortly after it opened. Unfortunately, the staff at that location have never really been \"on point\"...generally unfriendly, unknowledgeable, burnt bagels, incorrect orders...but I kept going because they always managed to get my soy latte right (except for once, when they used whole milk, and then gave me an \"oh, well\" attitude) and the parking is better. Over the past several months, my visits have become less and less frequent due to the poor service and general crankiness.\n\nWell, today was the last straw. I ordered an ollalaberry muffin, and when I finally got around to taking it out of the bag a couple hours later, it was moldy. I called them, and they guy who answered the phone insisted that they were baked fresh daily and that the ollalaberry \"always looks like that\". I informed him that I've never had one look like that before, and that it had big green patches all over it. Instead of offering to replace or refund, he offered me the manager's phone number; the number he gave me was to the other location, and when I tried to leave a message for Yolanda, the manager, her voicemail was full. I was unable to get through to anyone else using that number.\n\nWhy all this over a muffin? Because over the course of 15+ years I've dropped thousands of dollars in food and drink at the Mission location, and I hate to see a great place get bad reviews or lose business because of inept staff that could use some direct supervision and customer service training (and maybe some firing, too).\n\nMy advice? Skip them and deal with the parking at the other location.\n\nUpdate: this is a few weeks overdue, but I went back to the main location twice after the muffin fiasco. The first time was fine, even though they made my latte wrong (whole milk instead of soy...wasn't the usual barista) but they offered to fix it, so no big deal. The second time I went, the guy behind the counter (Scott?) rang me up, and after swiping my card, said, \"oh, you gave us a bad review\", and said that he recognized me from my Yelp picture. I said, yes, I had given the OTHER location a bad review and explained why. He proceeded to lecture me (and I use that word because that's what it felt like) on the characteristics and coloration of the ollalaberry muffin, on why I was wrong, that it wasn't mold, and so on and so forth. \n\nReally? What kind of service is that? Instead of trying to make things better, the staff gives me a talking-to? I really didn't need this at 8 :15 in the morning(or ever), and his harangue (plus getting pinned in their parking lot by a trash truck) actually made me late for work.\n\nYou know what? I'm 52 years old, I've eaten (way) more than my fair share of ollalaberry muffins, I know what they look like, and I know what mold looks like. You know how this whole thing could have been avoided? By some decent customer service. When I called the first time, the employee who answered the phone should have offered to replace the item or refund my money. I haven't called the manager back, because to be honest I really don't need yet another person telling me that I don't know what mold looks like.","date":"2016-12-28 21:42:58"},{"business_id":"R_8S3Iuhpzoi3nM-xq3kcw","name":"The Daily Grind","address":"2912 De La Vina St","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"CA","postal_code":"93105","latitude":34.4378527777,"longitude":-119.7271360056,"stars":3.5,"attributes":{"RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","OutdoorSeating":"True","BikeParking":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Alcohol":"'none'","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","Caters":"True","WiFi":"'free'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","NoiseLevel":"'average'","DogsAllowed":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': True}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","HasTV":"False"},"user_id":"cWair9Mq0wITn7zUH4MqcQ","review_stars":5,"text":"Great local coffee shop.

And if you're seated outside, they don't even pop head out the door. I had to ask for a fork. They didn't give me napkin. Then the lemonade for my friend came out the other side (after the salad). \n\nA mess, from service standpoint. But I will be back. \n\nWant to try their ice blended vanilla. Would save me a trip to Montecito\/Pierre La Fond (the only place I order that).","date":"2021-03-15 02:13:11"},{"business_id":"R_8S3Iuhpzoi3nM-xq3kcw","name":"The Daily Grind","address":"2912 De La Vina St","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"CA","postal_code":"93105","latitude":34.4378527777,"longitude":-119.7271360056,"stars":3.5,"attributes":{"RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","OutdoorSeating":"True","BikeParking":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Alcohol":"'none'","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","Caters":"True","WiFi":"'free'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","NoiseLevel":"'average'","DogsAllowed":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': True}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","HasTV":"False"},"user_id":"EWv2bU_N39SnnhCaQb921w","review_stars":1,"text":"The watered-down coffee in the hotel room is probably a better bet than ordering from here.

Truly I am.  Jacks used to be my favorite breakfast place to visit in Carpinteria.  I remember it having great food, so great in fact that we would usually come to Jack's both mornings we would spend in Carp on the weekends.  Not this time.\n\nWe ate here on a Saturday morning, they were moderately busy no waiting for a table or anything.  We ordered our food, two B-Eggls and we waited.  We waited for around 30-45 minutes when we were approached by the waiter to confirm our order.  I guess it was lost?  Then we waited more... about 30 more minutes went by and we debated leaving but the description in the menu sounded sooo good we thought, we've waited this long lets just eat.  Our food was brought and it was not as good as I remembered.  Our waiter also never refilled my tea the entire time we were there.  When we finished, we waited again. about 25 more minutes before I had to ask a waitress walking by for our bill.  By that time we were tired of sitting there and not fully satisfied with our breakfast.  On the upside... we were brought out some fresh fruit for free and not charged for our tea and coffee.  \n\nWe decided to give Jack's another chance on Sunday morning... I thought to myself maybe I ordered something different that I remembered being sooo good.  Maybe they were just having a bad day and that's why they were so slow.  This time it took 20 minutes after being seated to even be asked what our drink order was.  Not off to a good start.  I let her know how long we had been seated there and we ordered our food at the same time.  I had the vegetarian burrito and my boyfriend had the green chili burrito.  Our food came at a decent time although I had to ask for a refill instead of it just being filled for me.  Again, we were disappointed in the food!  No flavor.  And they forgot to put the avocado in my burrito.  This time once we got our check we paid at the register instead of waiting more.  The service was slow but nothing compared to the service from the day before.  \n\nDisappointed in the experience I had here.  Next time we go to Carpinteria we will definitely try somewhere new for breakfast.  I really am bummed to have written a bad review but we gave them a second chance!  Be warned that the menu items described sound so good but the food on the other hand really lacks flavor.","date":"2010-07-26 00:18:29"},{"business_id":"jrSC1bwN2lz9dVBrNTejSg","name":"Jack's Bistro & Famous Bagels","address":"5050 Carpinteria Ave","city":"Carpinteria","state":"CA","postal_code":"93013","latitude":34.398598,"longitude":-119.517515,"stars":3.5,"attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","WiFi":"u'no'","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","HasTV":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': True}","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': None, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'average'"},"user_id":"M60ud5uDw2sLPdrmgPW_SQ","review_stars":5,"text":"Delicious bagels and cream cheese!

When we arrived at the restaurant our table was set and the food was all ready for us. I found this amazing because we didn't have to re-order or even wait for our food!\n\nWe ordered the orange chicken and the honey walnut prawns. The chicken had great flavor and was not battered, which I really enjoyed because some places over batter and it just feels like you are eating a bunch of fried food. We really liked that the chicken was just whole pieces of chicken instead of battered. The honey walnut prawns had the perfect amount of sweetness and the walnuts had a lovely crispy crunch. Also, both entrees came with a side of steamed white rice which paired nicely with the sauce for the chicken and the glaze of the prawns. \n\nI almost forgot to mention that we showed up at 9:00 and the restaurant closed at 9:30.

I ate at China Palace on the 23rd with my boyfriend and his son. It was busy as one might expect, given that it's the only decent Chinese in town on a week when family and friends in cold climates visit their SB loved ones. \n\nThe food is good, as is the decor. This is not your average tacky Chinese restaurant (which is usually only slightly less tacky than most Thai places--they have the tackiest decor of all ethnic cuisine but I don't care because I love the food). A Shun Lee, which is fine dining Chinese on Manhattan's Upper West Side, is obviously not a local Chinese joint. Chin Chin on 49th and 3rd just closed after 25 plus years and it was known for its art deco interior with beautiful wood and old prints. That also isn't typical. \n\nBut the service is ABOMINABLE. It usually sucks but it was egregious. We got water after the meal was nearly finished. They never even came to give us silverware when we sat down. A couple next to us came in 10 minutes later and got their food 10 minutes earlier. \n\nIt was a disaster from start to finish. But you don't have a choice. Mandarin Palace in La Cumbre Plaza has great BBQ pork (and I'm not a big pork person), but a lot of their food is mediocre. And it's ugly inside. \n\nSo the reality is in a town known to have spectacular restaurants but bad Chinese food, China Palace could pretty much hurl won ton soup bowls at the heads of customers and get away with it. Also they serve ABC Chardonnay (Au Bon Climat) for 8.95 a glass and Tsing Tao is only 5 or 6 bucks, which on Coast Village Road, the main drag surrounded by houses starting at 2.5 million (for the shacks) and 3-4 million for nice homes, is very good. \n\nWhat a mess.\n\nP.S. I love many dishes here but the duck mu shu isn't one of them. It's crispy duck in a mu shu and thus greasy and heavy. Also I did not at all like the Capital Beef. This was a special with cilantro (which I love but could hardly discern) and chiles. The menu didn't say it was crispy, I don't think, so it was an overly salty, very fattening dish I barely touched. They have two or three great shrimp entrees and the kung pao is great.","date":"2014-12-25 21:06:25"},{"business_id":"UA3HxLprLSOO9J6l1iR2Cg","name":"China Palace","address":"1070 Coast Village Rd","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"CA","postal_code":"93108","latitude":34.4218178,"longitude":-119.6494861,"stars":3.5,"attributes":{"RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","GoodForKids":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","WiFi":"u'free'","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","Caters":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"None","HasTV":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"None","OutdoorSeating":"None"},"user_id":"GIGhGjjbVJZiKCSYsMXZtQ","review_stars":1,"text":"I was delivered food without eatware.

I went straight to Yelp and found this place to have the best reviews out of all of them, and also tasty looking food pictures. I really loved the venue, they made it look and feel exactly as if you're in China. I'd like to start off by saying our waiter, Jeffrey (I hope I spelled it right) was one of the best waiters I have come across at any restaurant. One thing I loved that he did was write down our minor requests as well such as when we asked for soy sauce, hot sauce, forks instead of chopsticks, etc. so he would make sure to bring out everything we asked for. He was the first waiter I noticed that did that, and I respected that. Other's just forget or ignore the fact that you asked for those things, and you have to ask multiple times before you get what you asked for. He was also very helpful when it came to ordering and helping us decide what to get. \n\nEnough about the service, on to the food. I was really craving Wonton Soup, hence the reason why we went to a Chinese restaurant. On the menu, they had Wonton Soup listed, and also Wor Wonton Soup, which was a more complex version of it, I assumed. I ordered a small Wor Wonton Soup, and it was perfect for the 2 of us. It comes with shrimp, chicken, baby bok choy, and pork dumplings in the soup. I'm guessing the regular one just has the broth and wontons. It really tasted great. The shrimp and chicken were cooked perfect, and the dumplings were the perfect bite size. \n\nAfter having Din Thai Fung in LA, I became a huge fan of dumplings. So we also ordered the ShangHai Steamed Dumplings, which I posted a picture of. The order came with 8 dumplings on a bed of lettuce, and they were pretty good. Not the best I've had, but definitely good enough to order if you're a fan of dumplings. Quick FYI thought, these dumplings require about 20 minutes for preparation (which Jeffrey did notify us about before we ordered). But it sure as hell was worth the wait. \n\nAs for the entrees, we ordered Crispy Walnut Shrimp and also Spicy Basil Beef. Crispy Walnut Shrimp is a personal favorite of mine and I get that no matter where I go. If they have it, best believe I'm ordering it, haha! And I'm going to be honest, I was not disappointed at all. I loved the batter for the shrimp, and the sauce was great too! As for the Spicy Basil Beef, we saw a lot of pictures of it on Yelp, and also a few good reviews about it. Jeffrey also recommended it and told us it was one of their more popular dishes. Eh, I didn't like it. It did not have even a hint of spice, and it just tasted weird. I'm not too sure if it was the basil, or just the dish itself wasn't great tasting to me.\n\nOverall, our experience here at China Palace was great. The service was great, their food was great, and its hella worth it if you're in the Santa Barbara area craving Chinese food. They do serve alcohol as well, that's a plus for some people, right?

We decided to order: cream cheese wontons, Hot and sour soup, BBQ pork chow mein, orange peel chicken, side of white rice and wontons crisps (I put these on the soup). Personally I am not a huge fan of the side sauces, but according to my boyfriend they were good as well! \n\nCaution, the chicken comes with chilies  for the spice and flavor. Perfect for exactly that but DO NOT EAT THE CHILES unless you're ready to soak your tongue in ice cold water the rest of the night...and yes I personally made this mistake. Live and learn right? BBQ chow neon was good and always a favorite of mine in these dinners. I never would have thought to have BBQ pork combined with the noodles, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I loved the wontons because it had the most amount of cream cheese goodness than other wontons I've had in the past.  \n\nYou can't forget to have the fortune cookies at the end right? I remember growing up these were so fun to me and the perfect ending to your Chinese dinner.

Anyway, I chose China Palace because my favorite Asian place to eat was closed for renovations.  There is a closer Chinese place in Carpinteria, but I've been there and, although the staff was friendly, the food wasn't so great.  So, I thought a place in Montecito might be better.  Not!  Although China Palace has a nice dining atmosphere, the food is average, the prices are higher, and the staff are below average when it comes to being inviting and grateful that you showed up.  When I encounter such staff, I wonder whether they understand basic economics.  They don't seem to understand that the money that shows up in their paychecks comes from the pockets of the people whom they are treating so poorly.  For good Chinese food, I recommend the China Pavilion, in Santa Barbara.  For great Thai food, you've got to try the Siam Elephant in Carpinteria.  Oh my gosh, it is good!

In addition, I think this is the first time I have ever written a review a negative review on Yelp, but after a week of thinking about it, it seems l'm motivated to do so...\nThe food is always very good. No complaints there. The drinks are generous, but this is where the problem arose. Three of us ordered scotch - 2 on the rocks and 1 'neat' with rocks on the side. The bill reflected an additional $1 per drink for 'rocks'. Not having noticed this on previous visits, I asked if they would please waive the $3 (on the $160 meal total) as there was no indication that they would be charging for ice. The gruff waitress immediately brought the manager in, who (and I can't put it any other way) arrogantly explained that because they give generous pours, they automatically charge an additional $1 per drink, but that it is NOT because of the ice. He said that the computer just prints it our that way. Clearly, I was not going to receive a $3 credit for having learned the house rules for my future drink orders, which would have seemed like the right customer service move to make. When the waitress returned to the table, she informed us that $1 had been taken off the bill, since one scotch was ordered 'neat' with rocks on the side. I asked why that would be, since the manager had just explained that the additional $1 is for a generous pour and asked \"wouldn't the pour be the same whether on the rocks or with rocks on the side\". She said no...that they give more alcohol when you order it on the rocks then when you order it neat. \nIn this surreal moment, I asked for her to please let the manager know that he got my $1, but lost a regular customer, at which point she walked away from me as she sarcastically said 'thank you'. \nSo....know you will unknowingly pay $1 more for a greater pour IF it's on the rocks...and I would suppose you'll pay the advertised cost if you want a lighter pour...the bill will say rocks, but that's not what it is...and you'll get less alcohol if you order it neat, but will most likely need to ask for them to take the $1 rocks charge off the tab before you pay.

I loved this place because it was always the neighborhood dive, kinda loud kinda funky with decent food and excellent service.......except last night.......","date":"2013-12-12 23:50:16"},{"business_id":"rPVmM0aJbC6lU_mnDiZ2Rw","name":"Tee-Off Restaurant and Lounge","address":"3627 State St","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"CA","postal_code":"93105","latitude":34.4400608,"longitude":-119.7413536,"stars":4.0,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BikeParking":"True","Caters":"False","HasTV":"True","GoodForKids":"False","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BestNights":"{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': False, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Music":"{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}","HappyHour":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': True, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True"},"user_id":"Ejd6cTY7mpvgBmx80Cu-3w","review_stars":5,"text":"We were in SB visiting family and looking for a place to have dinner.

Our lovely waitress, Jasmine, brought cocktails over right away, and laid a basket of warm crusty sourdough bread and crudit\u00e9s in front of us. We were already delighted! The menu offers soup AND salad - just like the old days. The clam chowder was authentic enough to please a New Englander - thick, creamy chunks of clam and potato and celery. Perfect! Now on to the best part - the meat! We ordered prime rib, which came perfectly cooked and accompanied by some amazing horseradish sauce (we asked for more) and garlic mashed potatoes, also heavenly and nicely seasoned. We also ordered the culotte steak which was as thick as it was wide and seared to juicy perfection. Lastly was the crusted sirloin, the star of the show with flavorful juices running through it and just spectacular! This is the place to go have a really epic  meat lovers meal, with perfect sides and well made cocktails.

There is nowhere except Vegas (the city of cheap good prime rib) you can get a dinner like this with salad and sides at the price point. \n\nEverything everyone says about the decor is true: dark, tablecloths, old real lanterns and red leather booths. The servers are older and wonderful and many have worked there for years. It's a trip back in time--and that includes the price. \n\nI wanted prime rib and so did my boyfriend so we decided to get the Eagle Cut for 45. It was enough for FOUR people. Not to be believed. It was like a live cow arrived at the table and called to mind Denis Leary's bit on vegetarians in \"No Cure for Cancer\" (1993): \"Forget that, bring me a live cow. I'll hack off what I want and ride the rest home!\" \n\nIt was quite lean in parts but when I got the leftovers home, I realized there was a large portion which was quite fatty. The terrific server, Gina, whom we tipped 30% because the bill came to what struck me as an embarrassingly low number pre-tip (62 dollars), brought 5 kinds of horseradish, ranging in intensity and creaminess. \n\nThe fresh bread is hot and addictive with heavenly sweet butter I could eat by the cup. \n\nThe Caesar is terrific and since we didn't get one of the sides, they brought us each a salad. \n\nI had a house vodka martini which was more than decent (not Ketel One or a top shelf booze) and boyfriend had a Stella. The veggies are a bit overdone but the rice pilaf was excellent and you can choose mashed potatoes, a baked potato or fries if you wish. \n\nIf we had tipped 20% rather than 30%, this gargantuan dinner would have come to 36 per person with one drink each. Unheard of. As it was it was 40\/person. Free parking so think of it as the money you would have spent on valet. \n\nNext time, we will split the Par Bake (30), which will be more than enough for two. \n\nI want to try the chicken (19), next time. The club menu is lower-priced with a  13 or 14 buck burger. \n\nWhen a restaurant stays in business nearly 60 years, there is a reason. In the case of the Tee-Off, it's terrific food at terrific prices and friendly, efficient service. \n\nI look forward to our next visit.\n\nMy boyfriend's favorite dessert is cheesecake and theirs is apparently terrific, but he was stuffed.","date":"2014-09-03 19:52:27"},{"business_id":"rPVmM0aJbC6lU_mnDiZ2Rw","name":"Tee-Off Restaurant and Lounge","address":"3627 State St","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"CA","postal_code":"93105","latitude":34.4400608,"longitude":-119.7413536,"stars":4.0,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BikeParking":"True","Caters":"False","HasTV":"True","GoodForKids":"False","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BestNights":"{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': False, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Music":"{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}","HappyHour":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': True, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True"},"user_id":"57RrPFEVizAvPTtXY-UsWw","review_stars":4,"text":"I think this is becoming my favorite restaurant in SB.

I ended up eating only one piece so I could save enough room for the prime rib.

The big Bertha tasted good but it was on the sweet side and it made it hard for my wife to eat a lot of it. My double eagle cut prime rib was huge and came out rare the way I like it.

REALLY dark. There are no windows and it was years before I realized how green the place is. I mean, it's golf themed but this place is all green. \n\nA long bar, which is where you'll find me, is tended mostly by Todd and Matt. Both will shake up a killer martini while a bottle of big, bold red wine sits ready for the main event. The dining room is split with high backed booths up front with a very loungey feel and tables in a back room where there is more light. Also a great room for a surprise birthday party (thank you Sarah S). \n\nBring your appetite!\nEnjoy a cocktail while you pursue the menu. As mentioned, I suggest red meat but more on that in a moment. The meal starts with a cold veggie tray then it's feeding time!\n\n'Big Bertha' $49 is a massive bone-in ribeye (I leave off the garlic marinade) that comes with Soup (prime rib soup!!!) or Salad, Rice or Potato, Fresh Seasonal Vegetables & Fresh Baked Sourdough Rolls. This is pretty much the only thing I order. Perfect for 2 and you'll have leftovers. Through Covid I've called in a take out a few times and it travels well too. Buyer beware. You'll need a big cutting board to carve this one up. \n\nPrime Rib $35-54 is the house specially, while they last. Multiple cuts for multiple appetites and again, I dare say, the best in Santa Barbara. Some pork, chicken and a fish or two too but come on. You know why you're here...COW. Moo. \n\nThis is a locals joint where you and team know each other by name and the kitchen crew says \"hi\" when you walk by. It's on the small side and people tend to linger and enjoy their time so make a reservation on weekends and holidays to ensure you have a seat. If you're lucky, you can slide into the bar and make some new friends. \n\nCheers and I'll see you at the Tee Off.","date":"2021-03-25 13:10:05"},{"business_id":"rPVmM0aJbC6lU_mnDiZ2Rw","name":"Tee-Off Restaurant and Lounge","address":"3627 State St","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"CA","postal_code":"93105","latitude":34.4400608,"longitude":-119.7413536,"stars":4.0,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BikeParking":"True","Caters":"False","HasTV":"True","GoodForKids":"False","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BestNights":"{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': False, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Music":"{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}","HappyHour":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': True, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True"},"user_id":"eRFamSPW1d6_uaJpw_drtg","review_stars":5,"text":"Foolishly didn't heed the advice of previous writers ... awesome food and lots of it!

I like being able to walk in without reservations     :)","date":"2012-02-05 03:22:39"},{"business_id":"rPVmM0aJbC6lU_mnDiZ2Rw","name":"Tee-Off Restaurant and Lounge","address":"3627 State St","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"CA","postal_code":"93105","latitude":34.4400608,"longitude":-119.7413536,"stars":4.0,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BikeParking":"True","Caters":"False","HasTV":"True","GoodForKids":"False","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BestNights":"{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': False, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Music":"{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}","HappyHour":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': True, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True"},"user_id":"ysCym8B-FyxIt72ZKm3OqQ","review_stars":5,"text":"I ate here so often I decided to get a job here.

Our first foray into a restaurant post-COVID lockdown, staff all had masks and the booths had plastic barriers between them. Only a few stools at the bar and limited allowed in overall; they did it right. We were thankfully able able to reserve a table a couple of hours before on a Saturday.\n\nThe Tee-Off is THE PLACE to get delicious prime rib in SB. It's normally a boisterous and dark locals lounge, but with the restrictions, it was actually quite nice and subdued for us and our three teen boys. Cocktails are generous (our oldest drives; heh, heh), and the wine list has mostly better known local wines. We started with some fat, crispy onion rings. Entrees come with soup or salad, choice of potato and veg. Salad and plate are cryo-cold and the prime rib soup is scrumptious. One son and I had the Par cut prime rib medium rare, which I like as it's not ridiculously huge - though you can order much bigger. The beef is pure heaven, full of flavor, juicy and perfectly cooked. I liked that I could have fries with it, which are crispy and nicely seasoned - good for mopping up the juices. My more cultured eldest ordered fried shrimp and rice pilaf with a Caesar salad (watch your waitress make it to order at the pass); he enjoyed everything. My youngest put away the 1\/2lb burger and wife had ground sirloin with mushroom and onion sauce and garlic mash. Everyone a happy camper.\n\nSure, that little dish of steamed veg is lackluster, but that's not what we're here for.

A traditional old school all American Resturant. The food is fantastic. the Prime Rib is top quality without the top price. I cannot order anything else but the Prime Rib every time we go there. the question is what size? The Double Eagle is huge and it tastes like they injected it with au jus sauce. Not only it feeds three or four but if it is only two of you, you can take the left over home and make Prime Rib Tacos the next day! Full bar a kind of atmosphere that reminds me of restaurants in 60's. A lot of golf players go there and when it is the season, and a game is on, the TV is on the golf channel. In Christmas season they have a modest traditional decoration that makes me feel warm and fuzzy. My family and friends have tried other items in the menu and they loved it. Oh by the way you must try their Prime Rib Soup! Add some fresh ground pepper and you will be all set. Order Martini, Scotch, Wine or whatever your heart desires. They have it.

But: the schroomers are still my favorite among all of the sauteed mushrooms i have eaten all over the world.

Yet the service has always been professional if it has not always been friendly or personal.\nI think that this is the major issue about the Tee Off and has always been.\nThe Ladies of the Tee Off tend to as a general rule segregate their tables into categories: the tourists, the veterans, the others.\nI have gotten great, personal service here and ok efficient service from a couple of servers.\nBut: i am smart enough to ignore any bs and just enjoy the company that i am with as well as the good to great food they serve here.\nWe started at the Bar and i have to say that the bartenders (Matt) here have always been friendly, enthusiastic and personal. Martinis and garlic bread? Yes!\nWe started with the famous Tee Off's plate of saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms and they are delicious as always: chocked full of big fat small creminis', wine, veal demi-glace . Always delicious and they never change.\nWe all ordered Prime Rib and shared the large cut, med rare. It arrived exactly as ordered with a big fat Baked Potato plus sour dough rolls. We both had a salad with Blue cheese. The greens are crisp and cold and the dressing is jammed packed with real blue cheese chunks. The Tee Off does not skimp on the accoutrements or the primary entrees, appetizers or desserts as well as the drinks. Oh, the drinks! Heavy pours are the going thing here and have always been as far as i know.\nThe food here is and has always been first rate: prime for the Beef and top choice for the pork and chicken. This is food that you can write home about.\nThe Chef in charge has his foot and hand on all that goes out to the customer and the final products show this firm grip.\nThe Tee Off bar opens at 4 with the restaurant at 5 most days.\nWe arrived early, had drinks and then the food at a booth in front.

First, the bad: based on another Yelp reviewer, we called at 7 an p.m. reservation on the Friday after Christmas. When we arrived we were told we were not on the reservation list because the person taking reservations, and they were all denying it, had not been actually writing names down on the list. At 8 p.m. it was packed. This had apparently had happened four times that evening alone, people showing up for their reservation with no reservation. Nonetheless, the manager was very apologetic, was trying to get to the bottom of it, and kept us appraised of tables coming available. All in all we probably waited only 15 minutes, 5 of which were at the bar (with a very attentive and very busy bartender). Once seated our service was quick and our waitress great. My fianc\u00e9 got a top sirloin steak and I got shrimp scampi. Both came with choice of potato (mashed, baked) or rice, soup (we got clam chowder) (great!) and salad. Dinner also came with bread and butter and a crudit\u00e9s tray. My fianc\u00e9 preferred his steak and gravy much more here than Harry's while I liked my Harry's scampi much more. It's a toss up! The decor was fun retro golf, definitely a dive. We dressed up for date nite but really you could go wearing almost anything on the nicer side.

We were up visiting Santa Barbara for 4 days during Christmas & as you all know, Christmas Day for dinner can be a choir in finding something open. Little did we know that the Tee-Off was going to be as good as it was. \n\nNow keep in mind, it's a bar\/restaurant, so if you have any issues with this type of environment, stay clear. But if not, you'll not be disappointed. We both ordered the Prime Rib, they happen to be known for their Prime Rib. \nShe had the small cut, 10 oz & I the bone in, maybe 16 oz discounting for the bone. Well our meals were delicious. As for the sides, not bad, yet no honorable mention either. \n\nWe would highly recommend the Tee-Off. Even if your taste lean towards a steak or seafood. Having a few conversations with other patrons, seems the Prime Rib, isn't the only thing they do well.\n\nLastly, reservations are strongly encouraged. \n\nA solid 41\/2 out of 5 Stars.","date":"2018-12-26 15:38:42"
